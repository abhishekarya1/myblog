Modern day technologies for sure provide much more efficient, convenient and sometimes creative solutions to our problems. Want to talk for free with a relative thousand miles away? Open an app and that's it, talk as much as you want, this was not at all possible before. Solutions like these are all around us and we use them on a daily basis. Stuck in a new city? Open the map app and get going, it will track you in real time too. Cool huh?

While the users happy that they can talk for free now and they've saved their money, they are paying a heavy price. Real-time location services are great but they do send data back to the servers in the name of _"Consumer Experience" _, _"Accuracy Enhancing"_ or _"Improvement Programs"_. The users forget that when they are talking to their friends and family the data goes through the server first and can be stored or manipulated easily. They forget that the data which they generate on their social media profiles can be used to manipulate them in return.

The mechanism or algorithms by which companies like Facebook and Google decide what ads to show you are already a recipe for disastrous results in the future.
The recent Facebook and Cambridge Analytica debacle is an example you will often hear me quoting, Facebook came out to be pathetic in handling the data of their 2.2 billion users and the questions put by the US Senators...don't even get me started with it.

User's data is just not secure anywhere. How many Google products do you use? Gmail, Chrome, Sheets, Google Search, and a lot more. Advertisements are the largest source of revenue for the tech-giant which is 70.9 percent of the total revenue. And certainly not all ads are shown to all people, they use your searches to determine your preferences and then what ads to show you, called 'Targeted much, there are no photos on their timeline and that their data is of no use to Facebook. This is where they are completely in the wrong, they fail to understand that even if they are not using the platform, their friends are active tagging them, sending them requests, etc.

One user might not care about their data, two users might not, but the _statistical inferences_ that can be drawn from the demography has a potential to cause mass-manipulation of people on political issues and things like these take no time to reach in the hands of people with no good intentions.

And this goes on as banks share data with insurance companies, social media and online searches to online shopping websites, and all of this happens with user unknowingly giving away permissions or they do not have an option.  
Your data juggles between these corporates while you enjoy your free calls and online shopping.
For this very reason, _International Data Protection Laws_ are on their way, they are theoretically very effective in tackling these multinational technology firms.

I'll give you one more reason not to trust tech firms with your data - they can and will share your data if the government demands it.
It happened in the [US](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/603709/hand-over-the-data), in the [European Union (EU)](https://eandt.theiet.org/content/articles/2018/04/tech-companies-may-be-forced-to-hand-over-user-data-under-new-eu-rules), and allegedly in [India](https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/india/has-paytm-violated-the-information-technology-act) too.

Your Privacy 0, Law Enforcement 1.

### Conclusion
So, you told me not to use Google, Facebook, and Twitter. What will I do on the internet then?

There are many alternate options available.
The right question to ask is - _What are these alternate options?_ 

* For Searches, you can use [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com), they never store any of the user's data,
* You can also clear _site data_ and _cookies_ after visiting a website to make sure that they don't remember you and everytime you arrive at a new user
* Turn your damn **Location** off for god's sake, you only need it while navigating or finding a place or route, keep it **off** otherwise.
* Avoid unnecessary signing in on websites when you are just browsing them unless you need their services badly.
* Create an email for just the purpose of signing in, don't use your Google+ or Facebook profile every time, or you can use a [temporary email](https://www.10minutemail.com). 

Considering the amount of time we spend online and the data we generate, it is not that only our data is in danger, we too are in danger.

Which raises the question - _Are we really secure?_
