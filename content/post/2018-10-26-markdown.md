## Markdown
[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a lightweight markup language that can be used to write plain text-format which can be converted to valid HTML. Using markdown you don't need to write content within HTML tags, you can directly write text with markdown syntax and it'll automatically get converted. You can also use HTML within markdown!

Today, markdown can be found in many places. [GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) uses it for writing documentation, [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/commenting) uses it for comments, you can try it out while writing messages in WhatsApp, you can write emails in it, much of the content you read online is written in Markdown. This post is written in Markdown too. It has an advantage that the person who is writing does not need to see everytime how it looks on a webpage. You can write with markdown syntax and the HTML pages will automatically be generated from it.

It looks very clean and it is easy to write too.

Here's the difference between some HTML and same goal achieved by Markdown -
```
HTML:

<h1>Markdown is <em>awesome</em>. Start using it now.</h1>

<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> is so cool,

it will make your life <em>easier</em><strong>A lot easier.</strong></p>

Markdown:

># Why *you* should use Markdown to write your next blog post

[Markdown][1] is so cool, it will make your life *easier*. **A lot easier.**

[1]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics
```
Notice how Markdown is a lot readable. But, after the content is posted online, they both look the same.

Though it is a lot different and far from the comfort of other [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) tools, it offers unparalleled writing speed, fluency, and fewer errors.
## Cheatsheet
Though Markdown has different "flavours" depending upon what you're using it for, this is a more generalized list meant to be used as a quick reference.

1. [Headings](#Headings)
2. [Emphasis](#Emphasis)

### Headings
```
# H1
## H2
### H3
#### H4
##### H5
###### H6

Alternalively, you can use undeline styles as follows:

Another-H1
==========

Another-H2
----------

```
# H1
## H2
### H3
#### H4
##### H5
###### H6

Alternative-H1
==============

Alternative-H2
--------------

### Emphasis
Many kinds of emphasis are available Emphasis in Markdown. Same as `<em>` tag in HTML.

```
Emphasis, aka Italics: *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka Bold: **double asterisks** or __double underscores__.

You can also combine them: **asterisks and _underscore too_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes: ~~wrong or sarcasm~~
```

### Lists
Proper indentation is required to display lists properly.

#### Ordered Lists
```
1. Item
2. Another item
and so on...

* Unordered list item
  * Unordered sub-list item

109. Numbers don't matter, just that it should be a number

1. Item
  1. Sub-list item 1

+ Plus can be used
- Minus can be used too

```

### Links
Direct, reference, and relative links can be created.

```
[Inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[Inline-style link with tooltip](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[Reference-style link][Case-insensitive reference text]

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Expand those references later:
[Case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.bing.com
[1]: http://abyssaltech.xyz

[Relative link to local](../docs/new/my)

[link text itself]

[link text itself]: https://www.google.com

```
[Inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[Inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google Homepage")

[Reference-style link][Case-insensitive reference text]

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

[Relative link to local](../docs/new/my)

[link text itself]

### Images

```
Absolute:
![Alt-text for image](https://abyssaltech.xyz/img/triangle.jpg)

Relative:
![Alt text for image](/img/triangle.jpg)

Reference-styled:
![Alt-text for image][image]

[image](/img/triangles.jpg)

```
Absolute:
![Alt-text for image](https://abyssaltech.xyz/img/splash.png)

Relative:
![Alt text for image](/img/splash.png)

Reference-styled:
![Alt-text for image][image]

### Highlighting
Code and syntax highlighting can be performed with Markdown. It differs from render to renderer.

We can inline-highlight text or block-highlight code.

```
back-ticks are used for inline-highlighting: `Important`

triple back-ticks are used for block-highlighting: code enclosed within '''

You can specify the language for proper highlighting:

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```.

```
back-ticks are used for inline-highlighting: `Important Stuff`

triple back-ticks are used for block-highlighting: code enclosed within ```

You can specify the language for proper highlighting:

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

### Tables
Tables aren't part of the original Markdown specifications, but they are there many a times.

```
| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| row 1         | top           |    4  |
| row 2         | middle        |    2  |
| row 3         | bottom        |    3  |

You don't need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily.

Much | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
Still | renders | fine
1 | 2 | 3

To change the alignment of the elements in a column, add a colon (:) to the left side, right side, or both sides of the appropriate set of hyphens on the second line. For example, inputting this:

Column L | Column C | Column R
:--------|:--------:|---------:
A1 | B1 | C1
A2 | B2 | C2
```

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| row 1         | top           |    4  |
| row 2         | middle        |    2  |
| row 3         | bottom        |    3  |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily.

### Blockquotes

```
> Here is a nice quote
> this line is part of the same code
```
> Here is a nice quote
> this line is part of the same code

A quote can also nicely align and wrap around when it is a really long one.

### Inline HTML
You are free to use HTML in your Markdown, and most of the times it'll work pretty good.

### Horizontal Rule
```
Three or more -

---

Hyphens

***

Asterisks

___

Underscores
```

### Line Breaks
One Newline won't break the line in Markdown, you have to hit Enter twice for line break.

```
Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.

### YouTube Videos

Videos can be added directly by just pasting their embed code inside Markdown.
