## Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey
**"I've watched it three times by now and each minute of the series teaches you something."**

It is a follow-up to the 1980 television series Cosmos: A Personal Voyage, which was presented by [Carl Sagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan), one of the greatest astrophysicists and science communicators, and it is considered a milestone for scientific documentaries.

The 2014 Cosmos is much more than meets the eye, it is an experience. A breathtaking journey into the infinite cosmos, distant planets, far away galaxies and into the awe-inspiring minds of some of the most brilliant minds that ever lived, people who changed our liver forever. It connects all of the disciplines of science together, from astronomy to philosophy. Form miniscule atoms to the idea of a multiverse, it will educate you in the most beautiful manner. It is a must watch for every science fanatic out there, and it'll be a journey you will never forget.

It is hosted by [Neil deGrasse Tyson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson), an American astrophysicist, author, and one of the most popular science communicators today. He spends a fair amount of time debunking mystical beliefs from the past and extolling the virtues of modern, reasoned thought and how science paved the way to the modern thoughts and inventions on which the modern world stands atop.
