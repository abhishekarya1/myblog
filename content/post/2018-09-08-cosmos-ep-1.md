This episode discusses our understanding of the universe. From defining our cosmic address, discussing lives and ideas of Copernicus and Giordano Bruno, introducing the cosmic calendar, and explaining how science is a cooperative enterprise spanning the generations.  

It opens with the famous opening line from the 1980's Cosmos by Carl Sagan: "The universe is all there is, or was, or ever will be."

And reminds us that...

- The Foundation of science are laid by generations of searchers, adhering to a simple set of rules -
	1. Test ideas by experiment and observation
	2. Build on those ideas that pass the test and reject the ones that fail
	3. Follow the evidence wherever it leads
	4. Question everything

## Our Solar System
The Sun is the center of the Solar System and also it is powering our world and holding other planets ("other worlds").

- **Mercury** is the closest one.
- **Venus** is dense cloud covered, plagued with a Runaway greenhouse effect, and it is hell for life to thrive
- **Mars** has as much land as the Earth itself
- **Asteroid belt** - A belt of rocky asteroids between Mars and Jupiter
- **Jupiter** - The Galilean moons are the four largest moons of Jupiter — Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. And almost a dozen little ones too. Jupiter has a solar system of its own, it has more mass than all the other planets combined.
  - **The Great Red Spot** - There is a raging hurricane on Jupiter, and it is three times as large as the size of the Earth, it has been raging for centuries now.

It has been of a great subject of intrest for astronomers and recently NASA's Juno spacecraft flew over it revealing more about the storm.
You can fly "into" the storm, as NASA created a visualization for it - [NASA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3Lq7Gu94Y)

- **Saturn** has rings made up of small rocks floating around in space such that each one can be called its "moon".
- **Uranus & Neptune** are outer planets, and were discovered after the invention of the telescope
-	**Pluto** is the most distant one, it is a dwarf planet.

**Voyager-1** is a space probe launched on 5 September 1977 by NASA. It is the most distant man-made object from Earth, at a distance of 2.1289×10<sup>10</sup> km or 21.289 billion km from the Sun as of 4 June 2018.

You can see live stats of the probe [here](https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/).

But this is not the only thing that is interesting about this probe. This probe carries a gold-plated disc in case the spacecraft should ever be found by intelligent life forms. The disc carries photos of the Earth and its lifeforms, a range of scientific information, spoken greetings from people such as the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the President of the United States and a medley, "Sounds of Earth," that includes the sounds of whales, a baby crying, waves breaking on a shore and a collection of music, including works by Mozart. Other Eastern and Western classics are included, as well as various performances of indigenous music from around the world. The record also contains greetings in 55 different languages.

- **Oort Cloud** - The Sun extends its gravitational pull in all directions further and trillions of icy particles and comets gets pulled in forming a roughly spherical cloud called the "Oort Cloud". But, no one can see the cloud, because they are farther away from each other, the nearest ones are as far away as the Earth from Saturn.

## Defining our "address" in the cosmos - Our "Cosmic Address"

Much like we have an address on the Earth, to locate ourselves in this vast boundless cosmic ocean, we need a cosmic address.

#### Level 1 - Earth

#### Level 2 - Solar System

#### Level 3 - Milky Way Galaxy

![Milky Way Image](/img/milky-way.jpg)

	- **Andromeda Galaxy** - It is located 2.5 million light-years from our sun and it is the nearest galaxy to us. Four billion years from now, our galaxy, the Milky Way, will collide with Andromeda also known as Messier 31. It consists of around 1 lakh crore stars, our galaxy, the Milky Way has only around 30,000 stars.

#### Level 4 - Local Group

#### Level 5 - Virgo Supercluster


#### Level 6 - Observable Univrese
