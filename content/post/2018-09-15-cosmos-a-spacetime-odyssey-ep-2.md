This episode discusses evolution, DNA, mutations, natural selection, tree of life, evolution of the eye, history of life on Earth, mass extinctions, and Geologic Time Scale.

## Selection
### Artificial Selection - Selective Breeding
Millions of years ago we domesticated some Wolves. Wolves with more submissive nature were accepted and more dominant ones were hunted. The genes of the domesticated wolves were passed down and became "the man's best friend" - Dogs. Then as now, this was a good deal for the humans, too.
The scavenging dogs weren't just a sanitation squad. They were also security. As this interspecies partnership continued over time, the dog's appearance changed. Cuteness became a selective advantage. The more adorable you were, the better chance you had to live and pass on your genes to another generation
It was the first time we took evolution into our own hands and we've been doing it ever since to shape plants and animals we depend upon.

In a mere 15-20 thousand years we turned grey wolves into all breeds of Dogs we see today. And we bred them for their looks so much so that we're actually [damaging some of them genetically](http://www.humanesociety.org/news/magazines/2010/05-06/the_purebred_paradox.html).

Humans shaping there environment isn’t just limited to domesticating wild animals, we shape everything in ways that better suit us, from animals, to plants, to the land around us. As further evidence of the plasticity of nature, here’s some other examples of artificial selection: Broccoli, Cauliflower, Kale, Cabbage, Collard Greens and Brussels Sprouts are all domesticated versions of the same wild species, Brassica Oleracea.) That corn you see today, that is not corn. It is [SUPER CORN](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/25/science/25creature.html).

### Natural Selection
Proposed by Charles Darwin in 1859, the most revolutionary idea in the history of science, the uproar it caused has never subsided.
It is a key mechanism of evolution, the change in the traits and characteristics of a population over generations.

To find out how it works, let's take an example of the Polar Bears we see today in the Arctic Region.

In the arctic regions, Polar bears enjoyed a distinct advantage over other bears with non-white coloured bodies. This colouring helped polar bears camouflage themselves better and enjoy higher levels of success in hunting their prey. This led to the slow dying out of non-white bears over the passage of time as they were easily seen on white snow by their prey and it became difficult to hunt and survive. Over the succeeding years, the gene for white bears spreads throughout the entire population of Arctic bears and in the Arctic regions non-white bears were nowhere to be seen.

**DNA** - DNA is a molecule shaped like a long twisted ladder or double helix. The rungs of the ladder are made of four different kinds of smaller molecules. These are the letters of the genetic alphabet that all life can understand. Particular arrangements of those letters spell out the instructions for all living things, telling them how to grow, move, digest, sense the environment, heal, reproduce. The DNA double helix is a molecular machine with about 100 billion parts called "atoms".

>"There are as many atoms in a single molecule of your DNA as there are stars in a typical galaxy. We are, each of us, a little universe."
