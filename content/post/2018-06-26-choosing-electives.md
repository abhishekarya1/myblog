It is mandatory for students of computer sciences in their fifth semester to choose an elective course. Electives are a great learning opportunity for students to learn something that is actually useful in real-life. Developing apps and websites, learning new technologies are all a part of the learning experience.
It is advised that you choose your elective course carefully after being aware of what to expect from the course and what after it.

This is a brief but insightful guide to choosing an elective. If you are still confused or if you do not know where to get started then you are at the right place.

It is assumed that the same elective course options will be offered to you that were offered to the Fall Semester 2017 students (our seniors) as in the date sheet below.

I have hands on experience and knowhow of every elective and I will be more than happy if I can be of any help to you in making your decision.
