It is mandatory for students of computer sciences in their **fifth semester** to choose an elective course as electives are a great learning opportunity for students to learn something that is actually useful in real-life.

Developing apps and websites, learning new technologies are all a part of the learning experience.
It is advised that you choose your elective course carefully after being aware of what to expect from the course and what you want to do after it.

This is a brief but insightful guide to choosing an elective. If you are still confused or if you do not know where to get started then you are at the right place.

It is assumed that the same elective course options will be offered to you that were offered to the Fall Semester 2017 students (our seniors) as in the date sheet below.

#### I have divided all electives in two categories -
- **Part-1** : Expect a lot of theory and concepts. Electives under these category are basically introductions to their respective fields.
- **Part-2** : Development and Programming. Electives under this category are more practical learning focused and expect a lot of programming if you choose them.

I have hands on experience and knowhow of every elective and I will be more than happy if I can be of any help to you in making your decision.

## 1. Introduction to Cloud Computing
Lets be very clear with the name - **Introduction** to Cloud Computing, it will be an introductory course covering concepts like types of cloud, deployment models, services, etc..

#### What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is basically storing, managing, and processing of data on another computer rather than yours.
For example, consider your WhatsApp messages or Contacts, they are backed up to the cloud(another computer) and even when your device is lost or damaged you can simply sign-in and get all of your messages or contacts back. If that data management would have been given into your hands you would have uninstalled every app from your phone, because you can hardly manage data of a single app manually, let alone hundreds of apps that you have on your phone.

Cloud Computing ensures accessibility from anywhere, anytime using any kind of device.

But Cloud Computing is so popular because of the ease of operation and scalability it provides to internet based businesses. Suppose a company or an individual sets up a website and wants to host it. How will they do it without cloud computing? They can just host it on their computer and give people address to their computer. But, can they ensure that they will be accessible every time?, even at night, what about when they are not around? Cloud Computing solves this by allowing companies to host their websites on another computers from people/firms who can ensure all of the above.

Another example is, suppose a website, some days it receives a lot of users, other day the number of users drop drastically, this keeps happening. The company cannot work with limited servers because that would hamper their growth, so should they go out and buy a new computer or system every time the user count is high? That would lead to a wastage of money as most of those expensive systems would sit idle when there are less users. Cloud storage renting companies like Amazon Web Services provide other companies a space to host and this leads to companies becoming worry free of maintaining a website and focusing on their actual product.

An app store can be an example of cloud storage. Suppose you made an app, how will you distribute it to people across the world if you have no app store. You'll have to send the app file to people manually. But storing all of the apps available in the cloud ensures accessibility.

Facilities like Gmail and Google Drive allows you to **manage** the software from your device, is the software on your device? No. You are just accessing it and managing it from your phone or computer.

With the help of Cloud Computing you can now execute your code on an [IBM Quantum Computer](https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net/qx) from your home that too from **any** device!

**Where you use it :** WhatsApp, Gmail, Google Drive, Dropbox.

**Who else uses it :** Every internet based company out there.

**Examples :** [Canva Online Editor](https://photo-editor.canva.com/), [Rabbit](https://www.rabb.it/), [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/), and a lot more...

<br>

You will learn many concepts and techniques used in implementing cloud computing. You'll be able to understand apps and platforms using cloud computing as well as you will be able to create cloud based solutions to real-life problems.

Expect a lot of theory and concepts, as it is an introductory course only.

## 2. Introduction to IoT
Again, pay attention to the name of the course and you'll realize that it is an introductory course for the vast field of Internet of Things (IoT).

### What is IoT?
IoT stands for Internet of Things. The internet is no doubt one of the most important inventions ever. It allows us to connect with other people and **share information**, we share all kinds of information over the internet.

An internet connection to a device allows it to share information too and it has yielded amazing results in the past, an example is your smartphone, it can access internet and send as well as receive data and therefore it is called a **smart** phone. How about we let devices share information over the network? Like a smart refrigerator which orders food before it is out of stock, or a smart TV that can send you alerts on your phone about your favourite TV show.

The internet was invented for computer systems, we enabled phones to connect to it and be on the network. Look where that led us. Today there are over 10 billion devices connected to the internet, these will be over 24 billion by 2020.

**The Internet of Things is actually a pretty simple concept, it means taking all the things in the world and connecting them to the internet.**

Information can be sent or received, an IoT capable device can do both. For collecting data for a specific purpose we need specific sensors like GPS for location or a camera for images. We also need another system that receives data and acts on it like a computer.


**Where you use it :** Assistants like Google Home and Alexa, Smartphones, Smart TVs, Smart Homes, Smart Watches/Bands, Wi-Fi enabled lights and home security systems.

**Who else uses it :**
- In 2015, Samsung announced that by 2020 every Samsung device will be connected to the internet. That means every washing machine, air conditioner or microwave oven will be online sharing data.

- Tech companies today are pouring money in buying other companies who manufacture smoke detectors, accelerometers, and other various kinds of sensors.

**Examples :** [Google Home](https://store.google.com/product/google_home), [Amazon Alexa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=UOEIH2l9z7c), [Internet of Things Technology in Use Today](https://beebom.com/examples-of-internet-of-things-technology/), []()

<br>

By the end of this course you will be able to come up with IoT based solutions to real-life problems as you will be acquainted with all the methods and techniques in the field of IoT.

But do keep in mind that knowing all the concepts out there does not by default enable you to design and program IoT enabled devices. To be able to come up with solutions and to program them you need to have a precise knowledge of programming and hardware, since you'll be working with Embedded devices, microcontrollers and sensors.

### 3. Wireless and Mobile Computing
