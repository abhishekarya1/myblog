It is mandatory for students of computer sciences in their **fifth semester** to choose an elective course as electives are a great learning opportunity for students to learn something that is actually useful in real-life.

Developing apps and websites, learning new technologies are all a part of the learning experience.
It is advised that you choose your elective course carefully after being aware of what to expect from the course and what you want to do after it.

This is a brief but insightful guide to choosing an elective. If you are still confused or if you do not know where to get started then you are at the right place.

It is assumed that the same elective course options will be offered to you that were offered to the Fall Semester 2017 students (our seniors) as in the date sheet below.

#### I have divided all electives in two categories -
- **Part-1** : Expect a lot of theory and concepts. Electives under these category are basically introductions to their respective fields.
- **Part-2** : Development and Programming. Electives under this category are more practical learning focused and expect a lot of programming if you choose them.

I have hands on experience and knowhow of every elective and I will be more than happy if I can be of any help to you in making your decision.

## 1. Introduction to Cloud Computing
Lets be very clear with the name - **Introduction** to Cloud Computing, it will be an introductory course covering concepts like types of cloud, deployment models, services, etc..

#### What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is basically storing, managing, and processing of data on another computer rather than yours.
For example, consider your WhatsApp messages or Contacts, they are backed up to the cloud(another computer) and even when your device is lost or damaged you can simply sign-in and get all of your messages or contacts back. If that data management would have been given into your hands you would have uninstalled every app from your phone, because you can hardly manage data of a single app manually, let alone hundreds of apps that you have on your phone.

Cloud Computing ensures accessibility from anywhere, anytime using any kind of device.

But Cloud Computing is so popular because of the ease of operation and scalability it provides to internet based businesses. Suppose a company or an individual sets up a website and wants to host it. How will they do it without cloud computing? They can just host it on their computer and give people address to their computer. But, can they ensure that they will be accessible every time?, even at night, what about when they are not around? Cloud Computing solves this by allowing companies to host their websites on another computers from people/firms who can ensure all of the above.

Another example is, suppose a website, some days it receives a lot of users, other day the number of users drop drastically, this keeps happening. The company cannot work with limited servers because that would hamper their growth, so should they go out and buy a new computer or system every time the user count is high? That would lead to a wastage of money as most of those expensive systems would sit idle when there are less users. Cloud storage renting companies like Amazon Web Services provide other companies a space to host and this leads to companies becoming worry free of maintaining a website and focusing on their actual product.

An app store can be an example of cloud storage. Suppose you made an app, how will you distribute it to people across the world if you have no app store. You'll have to send the app file to people manually. But storing all of the apps available in the cloud ensures accessibility.

Facilities like Gmail and Google Drive allows you to **manage** the software from your device, is the software on your device? No. You are just accessing it and managing it from your phone or computer.

With the help of Cloud Computing you can now execute your code on an [IBM Quantum Computer](https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net/qx) from your home that too from **any** device!

**Where you use it :** WhatsApp, Gmail, Google Drive, Dropbox.

**Who else uses it :** Every internet based company out there.

You will learn many concepts and techniques used in implementing cloud computing. You'll be able to understand apps and platforms using cloud computing as well as you will be able to create cloud based solutions to real-life problems.

Expect a lot of theory and concepts, as it is an introductory course only.

## 2. Introduction to IoT
