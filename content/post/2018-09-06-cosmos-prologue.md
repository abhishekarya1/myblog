## Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey
Cosmos is an American science documentary television series. It is a follow-up to the 1980 television series Cosmos: A Personal Voyage, which was presented by [Carl Sagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan), one of the greatest astrophysicists and science communicators, and it is considered a milestone for scientific documentaries. It is one of the top-rated television series worldwide and if you're not someone who watches TV shows at all, this is the thing you should definitely not miss.

The 2014 Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey is much more than meets the eye, it is an experience. A breathtaking journey into the infinite cosmos, distant planets, far away galaxies and into the awe-inspiring minds of some of the most brilliant minds that ever lived, people who changed our lives forever. It connects all of the disciplines of science together, from astronomy to philosophy. Form minuscule atoms to the idea of a multiverse, it will educate you in the most beautiful manner. It is a must watch for every science fanatic out there, and it'll be a journey you will never forget.

>"Open your eyes, and open your imagination. The next great discovery could be yours."        
- former U.S. President Barack Obama, introducing the series premiere.

It is hosted by astrophysicist [Neil deGrasse Tyson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson), who is also one of the most popular science communicators today. He spends a fair amount of time debunking mystical beliefs from the past and extolling the virtues of modern, reasoned thought and how science paved the way to the modern thoughts and inventions on which the modern world stands atop. Something that Mr. Tyson personally believes and always love to talk about.

It has 13 episodes and topics range from various objects in space and origin of life on earth to the stories of brilliant minds like Michael Faraday, Isaac Newton, and Albert Einstein.  

I've watched it twice by now and each minute teaches you something. I am going to re-watch it and this time I'll post my notes, elucidations, observations, and further thoughts on each episode.

## Some of my favorite quotes from the series -

>"Science works on the frontier between knowledge and ignorance. We're not afraid to admit what we don't know. There's no shame in that. The only shame is to pretend that we have all the answers."

<br>

>"Science is a cooperative enterprise spanning the generations. It's the passing of a torch from teacher to student to teacher; a community of minds reaching back to antiquity, and forward to the stars."

<br>

>"The stability of the earth is an illusion caused by the shortness of our lives."

## Still...
If you're still skeptical about all this, just listen to this mesmerizing excerpt from the book "Pale Blue Dot" by Carl Sagan. I promise that you'll be left spellbound.
