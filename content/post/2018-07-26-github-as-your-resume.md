## Git and GitHub


Many of you might have heard about Git and GitHub. Git is a _version control system_ created by Linus Torvalds (_the very same guy who created linux, btw, linux is named after him_) in 2005, it tracks changes to files and directories. GitHub is used extensively for hosting any kind of project and let other people contribute to them, it can be coding, design, review or writing documentation for any project.

One of the most successful projects on github include Bootstrap, JQuery, and Node.js. Besides this, organizations like Mozilla, Adobe and Twitter on Github are always in need for contributors to their public repositories. One can also contribute to some open-source organizations and communities like [FOSS Asia](https://github.com/fossasia) or [Facebook](https://github.com/facebook) and become a member. You just have to create a Github profile and you too can start contributing to other's repositories, it can be your friend's personal project, or find some software that you love, host your own project that you want other's to contribute to. You can also showcase your projects as well as see what other's are up to.


Some of my favorites include [VLC Media Player](https://github.com/videolan), [Google's Chromium Project](https://github.com/chromium), [Android](https://github.com/topics/android) and the most popular linux distribution, [Ubuntu](https://github.com/topics/ubuntu). You can also try to search the entire github by the search functionality, and filter by programming language and the kind of project you like.

#### What this post is about?
This post is all about how to use Github as an effective tool for developing, collaborating, and eventually increasing your chances of getting hired. A good Github profile can easily impress the interviewer. It reflects your coding style, tydiness of your work, workflow ethics, communication with other developers and your intrests, all at once.

By looking at one's Github repositories, you can almost immediately tell if he's an expert or beginner of a specific field. Resumes are becoming less and less valuable because people tend to exaggerate their past contributions/skills and it’s extremely hard to verify. Some people may even fake their resumes. In short, GitHub lets them see what you’ve built and how you built it, giving potential employees even clearer idea of your technical skills.

Github also provides further details like number of repositories, frequency of contributions activities, starred repositories, and number of followers/followings can also reflect how passionate the owner is about programming. Most famous programmers are quite active on Github. In the end, job candidates who take the time to develop their GitHub profile and participate actively in the community can be better evaluated than others.

## Get Started
0. Install Git-SCM (Recommended) or GitHub Desktop Client (Not Recommended).

1. Create a Github account and add some of your projects to it, don't worry if you do not have any, you can always go to other's project and **fork** theirs.

2. Once you have a repository in your Github profile, you can experiment with it, **clone** it to your local machine, make changes to it and **commit** those changes, and then **push** the changes you made. Then create a **Pull Request** to the original author and request a **merge**. Like this you can easily get started with using Git and GitHub

3. All your repositories, contributions, and activities will be shown on the profile home page. Example - [www.github.com/your_username_here].

## Getting it Right
GitHub was never designed as a place where programmers primarily exhibit their code to impress potential employers. It’s always been mainly a software development platform, the purpose of which is to make software development more efficient. If you're mentioning it on your resume, be sure you get it right.

### 1. **Maintain your repositories**  
Whenever you are working on something interesting, you can just put it to Github. It can be an algorithm you are just practicing writing, a piece of code or even a logo design you are working on. It serves as a backup for your work and you can access it from anywhere using the internet. Also, you can collaborate with others.

If you don’t know what to put on your Github, here are some suggestions:

- **Side Projects** - Working on a hobby or personal side project? Let others see and review it.
- **Course Projects** - You can also put up your projects on Github and mention the link on your project report. Ex - **ByteCode** was a course project for Semester-4 Database Management Systems - Project Based Learning (PBL) Lab.
- **Open Source Projects** - Contribute to open source projects, **fork** them and they will show up as your repository, you can also **star** them for later review, or **watch** them for any changes.


### 2. **Keep your code clean** 
Nobody tells you this because it is obvious. If you write bad code, it will not only waste other's time in understanding your code but it means that you are inexperienced and not capable of developing software in a team. If your code is dirty, chances are you yourself will be looking at it, having no idea what it does, after sometime of writing it. Comment appropriately.

You can follow Google style guide for [Java](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html), [C++](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) and [Python](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md), which are very popular amongst professional developers.

### 3. **Be Professional in Communicating**
Weather you are writing comments in your code or explaining the changes you made while making a Pull Request, you need to be clear and precise in what you want to convey to other developers and coders.
- **Write clear Descriptions** - Everybody reads the description. No one will read your code to understand what you are working on.
- **Always include a well formatted README file** - It’s highly recommended to have a README for every repository, it has detailed instructions in it on how to use the contents of your repository, resources, links and sometimes a list of contributors.
- **Use Issues to track bugs**
You can use Github Issues to keep track of all the bugs. It makes a catalogue of all known features, and organizes them in a very intuitive manner, which makes it easier for reference to other coders inn the later stahges of develo[pmetnt Ex - Open or unresolved/resolved issues.

## What GitHub cannot tell you about someone?

Some programmers use GitHub as a way to backup their code, some want to collaborate, others just want a hosted page for their projects and documents, etc. Some projects may be well-documented and useful software, others could be experiments, or code you could hardly call software. In the end, all that you see is not always useful in a Github profile. And most importantly, what if you decide to keep your projects private. Unlike open source projects and contributiuons, these won't be visible to your recruiter.


## Myths

A person not active on Github doesnt mean that he is a bad developer. They don't like t



## Ending Notes

Yet, in spite of its shortcomings, you can use your GitHub profile as a leverage to score a great new job. It only takes a bit of effort to make it more self-explanatory and recruiters-friendly.
