In the last post, I talked about how people unknowingly give away the data which can be used to draw statistical inferences to a large degree of accuracy for a particular region or a country. There is another bigger threat to our data - **'Data Breaches'**.



### Conclusion
As I already said, you cannot do much after it happens, but to choose the safest store or platform is always in your hands, you may call it some precautionary measures.

* For starters - **Research**. Search about popular data breaches and be aware of them, you can go to the Wikipedia Page <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_breaches">here</a>.
    * You can also check if your data has ever been compromised in the past <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com">here</a>.
    * [Vigilante.pw](https://vigilante.pw") lists over 2,100 websites which have had their databases breached, containing over 2 billion user entries in total.
    * You can also take a look at this cool interactive chart of the worst data breaches <a href="http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks">here</a>.
    * And check out the biggest data breaches of the 21st century <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2130877/data-breach/the-biggest-data-breaches-of-the-21st-century.html">here</a>.  
* If you are good till now, always keep your eyes peeled from the next time onwards.

Considering how little control we have of our own data once it gets stored in the databases of tech firms, it is high time we start analyzing which services to use and which ones to avoid. Or else we will lose control of our own data and politicians and hackers will definitely leave no stones unturned to use that data for egocentric and self-centered unhuman deeds.
