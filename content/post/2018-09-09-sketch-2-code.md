## What seems to be the problem with building HTML pages?
I think it has to do with the amount of work one has to do for building just the structural components. With machine learning, we can easily identify these components like lines, text, and boxes, and create code for it. But web designers can do that more efficiently. The problem is the brainstorming. When having a lot of ideas in the mind, you can draw them on a paper or whiteboard in a jiffy, but the same is not true for code, which is a hefty amount of effort and not something designers want to do as it delays the design process.

Those of you who have used Microsoft Frontpage like me

## Sketch2Code
Microsoft AI's Sketch2Code is a solution that uses AI to transform a handwritten user interface design from a picture to valid HTML markup code.
