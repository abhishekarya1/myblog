In [Part-1](/post/2018-06-26-choosing-electives-1/), I talked about courses which require you to understand concepts and learn them so that you can get started with building actual stuff with them.

In this post however, I am going to be talking about the courses in which you are going to freely experiment with the tools and you are definitely going to make something, say a simple app or a website during the course. These courses are more development focused and you must choose among these if you want to **create** something.

I have devoted a fair amount of my time developing Websites like this one, engineering Android apps and programming with Python for Machine Learning,
and that is why I decided to give others an insight of all of these courses so that they can get some help in deciding what is the best option for them.

## 1. App Development for Android
Android is a mobile operating system developed by Google primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.

#### It is just another OS, what makes it so special?
Well, Android is so great because of the open source community, Android Open Source Project (AOSP), not even Google alone could have driven Android to the state it is in now. An active community of people contributing to make an operating system for mobile devices is what makes Android great, which lacks in other operating systems like iOS and Windows. The community of developers, programmers and enthusiasts bring to the table, a plethora of updates, bug fixes and improvements faster than the official manufacturer. Also, this is why Android courses are taught in colleges. You can learn to build apps and then start contributing to the community too, making it more secure and feature rich.

There is also a **huge** app store ([3.3 million apps](https://www.statista.com/statistics/266210/number-of-available-applications-in-the-google-play-store/)) for Android and most of the apps are free. People can develop more and more apps and publish them to the store because of this _open_ nature of Android. Also Android has a large user base because much of the devices that run Android are cheaper than others. Some people mock it, but the back-end code and the underlying organization in Android is far much efficient than others and that is why Android is the most popular mobile OS with a whopping userbase of over [2 billion monthly active users](https://twitter.com/Google/status/864890655906070529). If you sit down and think about it, that is actually a phenomenal amount of users for a single piece of software.

Android leads the global market with 87.9 percent of market share. Sure developing apps and features for it is not a bad idea at all. You can start developing apps and get your hands dirty with the backend and the linux kernel, then you can right away contribute to the development of Android. Or, you can develop Android apps for organizations and individuals and remain and Android developer, it surely pays off well.

**Scope:** Apps for businesses, apps for NGOs, freelance app developer, build your own apps, start contributing to the Android community, software for ChromeOS and other Android powered devices.

**Where you use it:** [Smartphones](https://www.android.com/phones/) & [Tablets](https://www.android.com/tablets/), [Smart TVs](https://www.android.com/tv/), Smart Watches - [WearOS](https://wearos.google.com/), [Car Systems](https://www.android.com/auto/), [IoT](https://developer.android.com/things/), Desktop Operating Systems - [ChromeOS](https://developer.android.com/chrome-os/intro)

**Who else uses it:** Every user of the devices listed above, companies and organizations with an Android app for their businesses or needs, [ChromeOS](https://developer.android.com/chrome-os/intro), [WearOS](https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/)

- Android DevStories - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlyCyjh2pUe88f-w-EpsYGgApsQTkr8bK)

You will learn many concepts and techniques used in making android apps for potentially billions of people out there. You'll be able to understand apps and functionalities as well as you will be able to create apps and come up with solutions to real-life problems that can be solved with it. Besides, you can build a ton of apps for yourself and showcase them as projects or publish them on the play store.

Expect a lot of programming, design as well as concepts throughout the semester and beyond if you decide to develop apps further.

## 2. Programming with Python
Python is the latest buzzword nowadays in the field of programming, you must have heard of it from someone. It is often mistakenly though of as a new language but it is not. Python was first released in 1991. Python is different from other programming languages you learnt till now, C and Java, as it is less strict in terms of syntax, and it has applications ranging from Machine Learning and Web Development to Scripting and Hacking.

Python is much simpler and leads to faster development, it is easy to learn and is the best programming languages for beginners, no doubt in that.

Python is the way to go if you want to get started. But, _if you already know any other programming language well, then my advice would be to **skip** learning Python_. Sure, learning it will never hurt you, but you may not want to miss on the Web Development and Android Development. That being said, if you've already decided that you want to do, say, machine learning with Python, then you should definitely choose Python. But if you are still not sure of anything, allow me to explain further.

**Advantages over other programming languages -**

- Easy to learn for beginners as the syntax is simpler
- Increased readability of code
- Shorter code lengths as compared to other languages like Java and C++
- Increasing hype and opportunities
- Leading language for Machine Learning and Data Science
- Best for writing small scripts
- Django Web Framework, Flask Framework and a lot of libraries available to do different tasks

**Disadvantages -**

- Python is interpreted, it runs code line by line, this makes it extremely slow and unsuitable for performance
- Far from the hardware, its impossible to write efficient kernel code and other low latency programs in Python
- Traditional programming barriers. Most of the most widely used programming standards and syntax were omitted by Python, see yourself,

**FOR Loop in Python**
```
for i in range(1,10):
    print i
```
**For loop in C++**
```
for(i = 1; i <= 10; i++)
{
cout << i;
}
```
 No semicolons and a loose syntax, this will definitely make you care less about the syntax, but when you try and create Data Structures in it, you will find yourself searching on the internet for hours about syntax.

- Userbase. Though Python is all the hype nowadays, and it has the potential to be an all encompassing multipurpose language, it is not anywhere near. Much of the Web Development is on PHP and JavaScript, app development in native SDKs like Android Studio(Java/Kotlin) and Swift, Low latency software in C/C++ and Games are being made in C#. Right now, Python leads in the Machine Learning and Data Science fields only.
- **This is not actually the right time to switch to a new programming language if you are not clear with basic programming and Object-oriented concepts, do keep in mind that Data Structures too are very important, practice them with the programming language you currently know (most probably C or Java) and then learning a new programming language is only a matter of hours to get started with it.**

**Where you use it:** Instagram, Mozilla Firefox, LinkedIn, NASA's Website. They all use Django, a web framework written in Python.
YouTube, Google Search, Quora, Reddit, BitTorrent. They all use Python.

**Who else uses it:**

- In 2015, Samsung announced that by 2020 every Samsung device will be connected to the internet. That means every washing machine, air conditioner or microwave oven will be online, sharing data with each other.

- Tech companies today are pouring money into buying other companies who manufacture smoke detectors, accelerometers, and other various kinds of sensors.

**Examples :** [Google Home](https://store.google.com/product/google_home), [Amazon Alexa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=UOEIH2l9z7c), [Internet of Things Technology in Use Today](https://beebom.com/examples-of-internet-of-things-technology/)

By the end of this course, you will be able to come up with IoT based solutions to real-life problems as you will be acquainted with all the methods and techniques in the field of IoT.

But do keep in mind that knowing all the concepts out there does not by default enable you to design and program IoT enabled devices. To be able to come up with solutions and to program them you need to have a good knowledge of programming and hardware since you'll be working with Embedded devices, microcontrollers, and sensors.

## 3. Wireless and Mobile Computing
Another concept based course, a major part of the course will be theoretical.

Wireless networks are networks without wires, they use air to send and receive signals which carry data. Mobile computing refers to the device being able to change locations and get transported while being able to stream data without interruptions like your mobile phone.
This course will be a further extension to the Data Communications from the third semester. All of the tools and techniques used for data communications will be applied to Wireless networks and advanced concepts like Radio propagation and modulation techniques in mobile will most probably be taught.

This one, in my view, is strictly an **Electronics and Communications** course inclined towards _well_, electronics and communications.

**Where you use it:** Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Cellular Networks, Wireless Speakers, ScreenCast, Wireless Charging.

**Who else uses it:**

- When entire communication lines collapse in an earthquake, it is Wireless networks that are up and running.
- Cellular networks are everywhere as you know as they can also provide services in far away remote places.
- Wireless technology is easy to deploy than laying down communication lines, and hence it is [trasforming lives](https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/19/how-mobile-technology-is-transforming-lives-in-rural-india/).
- With [5G Coming](https://telecomreseller.com/2018/06/25/5g-on-the-horizon/) this is the most exciting time to learn about networks and communications.

- [Different Types of Wireless Communication Technologies](https://www.efxkits.us/different-types-of-wireless-communication-technologies/)

That being said, I have studied many things from this field like Mobile Computing, 1G, 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G, Wireless Internet, Data Transmission, Channels, and Networks, and I assure you that once you get started with it, it is quite interesting to learn.

## To be Continued...
In **Part-2**, I'll be covering the remaining courses as they are more inclined towards development and follow a _hands-on learning_ approach and good programming, as well as creative skills, are required to learn them.
