You must've heard about tech giants not taking the protection of their user's data seriously at all, yet again. And various news articles are already doing the rounds of my news feeds, yet again.

From [Quora](https://inc42.com/buzz/quora-announces-data-breach-affecting-100-mn-users-globally/) to [Facebook](https://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/a25645143/facebook-privacy/) (_well no surprises there_), and even TRAI's Chairman R.S. Sharma's personal details [were posted online](https://inc42.com/buzz/aadhaar-database-wasnt-hacked-to-fetch-details-of-trai-chairman-rs-sharma-uidai/) after he openly challenged the Internet to do so.

**On 21 December 2018, The Ministry of Home Affairs issued an order authorising 10 Central agencies to intercept, monitor, and decrypt "any information generated, transmitted, received or stored in any computer."**

If this does not make you uncomfortable, I don't know what will. They can now access all of the information stored on your devices, **legally**.

This guide is meant to be a list of tools and services you must use to protect yourself from snooping. These tools are trusted and are used by many people. Most of these are used my me and they are completely safe to use.

### Conclusion
As an end-user your role is minimal, but you should be aware of the scenario.

- Just download the latest update for your operating system, smartphone, router etc... and you should be fine. These updates patch most of the known vulnerabilities till the day they are released to the end users.

- Make sure you are not using a _super-old_ firmware on any of your devices, they are the ones which are affected severely during an outcry and its a hundred percent user's fault that they did not update it in time, despite the developer releasing them beforehand.
