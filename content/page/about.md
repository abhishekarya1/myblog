My name is **Abhishek Arya**. Some things about me, including but not limited to, love for computers :

- I absolutely hate small talks and avoid them completely, no offence. 🙂
- I am a typical neighbourhood geek - vsauce, xkcd, Cyanide & Happiness, watching rocket launches when I'm bored, paradoxes and thought experiments.
- I am on a journey to discover my true passion in computer sciences and technology, which hopefully I can find somewhere here on the internet.
- The journey so far has been great, I have done many things - from Programming and Scripting to Ethical Hacking, designing graphics, reverse engineering apps, modding random stuff, and tinkering with the code of just about everything.
- Currently, I am getting my hands dirty with some coding, development, and deep learning. 👨‍💻
- I can always tell you some random cool thing, ask me the next time you meet me! 😉
- I love reading about technology and gadgets, and to use them in the most innovative ways possible (read _hack_), you'll always find me jabbering random tech related news, jargons, and trivia.
- I am always learning new things and I need to dump my cluttered mind somewhere. I have made it my goal to post it here on this blog as frequently as I can.
- Some of my [favourite documentaries and shows](/page/documentaries).
