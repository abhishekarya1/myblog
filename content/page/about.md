My name is **Abhishek Arya**. I try my hands on everything that a computer can do :

- I am on a journey to discover my true passion in computer sciences and technology, And hopefully I can find that somewhere here on the internet.
- The journey so far has been great, I have done many things - from Programming and Scripting to Ethical Hacking, designing graphics, reverse engineering apps, modding random stuff, and tinkering with the codes of softwares.
- Currently, I am getting my hands dirty with some coding, development, and deep learning.
- I can always find cool things on the internet, even if I can't, I make sure to look in the depths of the Deep Web.
- I love reading about technology and gadgets, and to use them in the coolest ways possible, you'll always find me jabbering random tech related news and terms.
- I am always learning new things and I need to dump my cluttered mind somewhere. I have made it my goal to post it here on this blog.
